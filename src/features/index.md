3. Click an item to find it from AniList or long press for more options.

### Trouble finding a title?

If you encounter difficulties while searching for a specific series, consider the following points:

* Double-check your spelling and try again, as some sources might use **Japanese Romanized** titles instead of **English** ones.
  > Example: **Boku no Hero Academia** instead of **My Hero Academia**.

* Some sources may use different spellings or wordings for titles.
  > Example: **Bungo Stray Dogs** instead of **Bungou Stray Dogs**

  > Example: **3-gatsu no Lion** instead of **Sangatsu no Lion**.

### Adding external progress

Long press the item cover image to open the list editor and add, modify, or delete progress.

### Syncing progress between devices

* Log in to AniList and enable `Settings => Common => Sync episode / chapter progress`

### Source prioritization

_Warning: Enabling with slow sources or internet may cause delayed loading of media pages_

Himitsu offers a special feature to help filter sources that offer a specific title.

* `Settings => Common => Prioritize source list` will list sources with an item at the top
* `Settings => Common => Source search timeout` will determine how long to search a source

### Torrent support

- Clicking a torrent will prompt to enable torrent access temporarily (preferred)
- `Settings => Anime => Internal TorrServer` will enable persistent torrent access

Once enabled, clicking a torrent will launch it using the regular video player
