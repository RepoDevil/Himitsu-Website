### Trouble finding a title?

If you encounter difficulties while searching for a specific series, consider the following points:

* Double-check your spelling and try again, as some sources might use **Japanese Romanized** titles instead of **English** ones.
  > Example: **Boku no Hero Academia** instead of **My Hero Academia**.

* Some sources may use different spellings or wordings for titles.
  > Example: **Bungo Stray Dogs** instead of **Bungou Stray Dogs**

  > Example: **3-gatsu no Lion** instead of **Sangatsu no Lion**.

### Reverse Source Search

If you want to search for a title across all your sources, you can use the Reverse Source Search feature.

Follow these steps:

1. Click on the icon at the top right to open the quick settings dialog.
2. Click on the search bar and enter some search text.
3. Click an item to find it from AniList or long press for more options.

### Adding External Progress

Long press the item cover image to open the list editor and add, modify, or delete progress.

### Syncing Between Devices
`Settings => Common => Sync Episode / Chapter Progress`

Requires logging in to AniList in order to create a sync profile.
All progress data is stored using an anonymous authentication.

### Quick Resume
`Settings => Common => Add Shortcuts to Launcher`

On newer Android devices, holding down the application icon from your device launcher will open a menu of common actions. For example, a messaging application will list recent contacts. For Himitsu, this will be the most recent read or watched items.

### Loading Affinity
`Settings => UI Settings => Loading Affinity`

Some devices and internet connections are faster than others. When more data is loaded at once, fewer loads need to be performed. When less data is loaded at once, loading is completed faster. Affinity is how this is balanced for the device and connection using it.

### Source Prioritization

_Warning: Enabling with slow sources or internet may cause delayed loading of media pages_

`Settings => Common => Prioritize Source List`

Attempts to sort sources based on a timed quick search of their content using the selected media title

`Settings => Common => Source Search Yimeout`

Search timeout determines how long to attempt searching a specific source before skipping to the next

### Torrent Support

- Clicking a torrent will prompt to enable torrent access temporarily (preferred)
- `Settings => Anime => Internal TorrServer` will enable persistent torrent access

Once enabled, clicking a torrent will launch it using the regular video player

### Client and Limited Modes

#### Client Mode

Client mode allows use of Himitsu as a regular AniList tracker with some integration for official streaming sites. all extension features and menus are disabled.

#### Limited Mode

Limited mode is a modification on the offline mode common in other apps. Unlike most apps, some features that use internet may still be enabled. Options are provided to enable an offline database, the continue watching and reading list, and extensions. Tracking can also be stored until returning online.

### Securing Himitsu
`Settings => System => Biometric Verification`

Biometric verification allows using fingerprint or, when supported by the device, facial recognition to unlock the app.

### Floating Avatar Button
`Settings => UI Settings => Floating Avatar Button`

Clicking on the avatar and dragging it away from its origin will produce a second, identical avatar that can be moved freely about the screen. This button will open a list of all subscribed items similar to the quick resume menu. This floating button will lock back in place when leaving the home screen or dragging it back to the main avatar. This feature is strictly for novelty purposes.
