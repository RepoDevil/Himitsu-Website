*This project does not provide any content. All extensions have been retroactively stripped upon creation of the fork. Add-ons are developed and distributed by Dantotsu. Content is provided by AniList, MyAnimeList, MangaUpdates, and other third-party integrations who retain all rights.*

Himitsu provides the ability to log in to AniList, MyAnimeList, Discord, and various other sites. Some information about an account may be stored, such as username or token, to be used for the sole purpose of maintaining a connection, identifying the user, and  / or performing actions at user request. This information is used in accordance with safety standards set forth by Google Play.

Himitsu, itself, does not store or share any user information beyond simple identification or encrypted tokens without express consent from the user. This includes, but is not limited to, device characteristics and crash data.

The Discord Remote Procedure Call, also called the Discord RPC or Rich Presence, is enabled when logging into a Discord account and displays information about active media in the user profile. Optionally, an AniList username may be displayed in lieu of a link to the application.

Please note: The Dantotsu comments API is disabled by default, but enabling this option implies acceptance of the Dantotsu terms and privacy policies. We are not affiliated with, nor do we monitor, the quality and safety of this functionality. Use it at your own risk.
